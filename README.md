Welcome to the Internet Price Analysis project! This project is to examine the cost of internet service in various countries around the world using Python and MySQL.

Access to the internet has become increasingly important in recent years, as it allows individuals to connect with others, access information, and complete various tasks online. However, the cost of internet service can vary significantly depending on where you live. Some countries have relatively affordable internet prices, while others have much higher costs.

To conduct analysis, we will be using Python, a powerful and popular programming language that is widely used in data analysis and scientific computing. We will also be using MySQL, a popular database management system, to store and manage our data. To connect Python and MySQL, we will be using the MySQL Connector package, a Python driver that allows us to access and manipulate data stored in MySQL databases from within our Python code.

By conducting this analysis, helps to gain a better understanding of the factors that affect internet prices and identify areas where improvements could be made to increase access to affordable internet service. Through the use of Python and MySQL,  will be able to perform powerful data analysis and visualization, helping us to better understand the trends and patterns in internet pricing around the world.
